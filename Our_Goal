The final goal for this prject is described below:

This demonstration will simulate a completely automated CI/CD deployment pipeline using Jenkins. 
It will essentially do the following steps (phases):

 1. Pull the source code for a Java EE based Project from GIT. (SCM AUTOMATION)
 2. Compile (build) the code using Maven to generate the .war file (BUILD AUTOMATION)
 3. Run Test cases & ensure they pass. (TEST AUTOMATION)
 4. Copy the .war to a Docker build workspace (DEPLOYMENT AUTOMATION)
 5. Build a Docker image for Jboss server to run the war file. (DEPLOYMENT AUTOMATION)
 6. Deploy the Docker container on a target node. (DEPLOYMENT AUTOMATION)

Prerequisites

This Demo should have the actual prerequisites of what we have done during the Manual Java compile method as per the,
How To described in the file How_TO_hellobuild

Also if you want to try the installation without terraform & ansible make sure, 
the following steps are completed before youtrigger the build pipeline

"echo "jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers"
"echo 'Defaults:jenkins !requiretty' >> /etc/sudoers"
"setenforce 0 # Else disable SELINUX in /etc/sysconfig/selinux  and reboot"
