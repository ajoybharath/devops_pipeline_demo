You need to thoroughly walkthorugh the scripts before adding in the builds. 
There might be missing/misplaced commands so be sure of the script ;-)

Now your challenge is to change the above build methods considering the following scenarios:

1. Change the steps/scripts in such a way that once your docker build is done push the docker to the 
public docker hub to your docker hub account.

2. During the deployment phase let a terrafrom code runs to create a new instance and ansible creates a container in the new instance 
by pulling the image from the public docker hub. 

3. Inspired from these build scripts try to create a declarative pipeline so that the build actually pulls
a Jenkinsfile from your repository and start the build.
